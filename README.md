# Image_Caption_Generator

Image caption generator helps to generate captions on different images. This model is using hybrid approach. 
We have a CNN using transfer learning from Xception model pre trained om ImageNet dataset and we have RNN model - LSTM for text analysis, text sequence and generating captions.
I have used Flick8 dataset for this. Dataset have 8000 images. Model was trained on 6000 images.
